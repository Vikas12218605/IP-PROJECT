 <h1> <center><i>"What Is Climate Change?"</i></center> </h1>
 <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather 
patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar 
cycle
 . But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of 
climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
 </p>
 <p>Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like 
a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising 
temperatures.
 </p>
 <p>Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change 
include carbon dioxide and methane.
 These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating 
a building, for example.
 Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide.
 Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane 
emissions.Energy, industry, transport, buildings,
 agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.

 <br>
 <br>
 <h2><i><center>'Greenhouse Gas Concentrations are at their highest levels 
in 2 Million Years!!'</center></i></h2>
 <p>And emissions continue to rise. As a result, the Earth is now about 
1.1°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s. 
 The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record
 </p>
 <p>Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But 
temperature rise is only 
 the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system,
 where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence 
changes in all others
 </p>
 <p>The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense 
droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting 
polar ice,
 catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.

 <br>
 <br>
 <h2> <center><i>'People are experiencing climate change in diverse 
ways!!'</i></center></h2>
 <p>Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, 
safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts,
 such as people living in small island nations and other developing 
countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced 
to the point 
 where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted 
droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of 
“climate refugees” is expected to rise.
 </p>

 <br>
 <br>
 <h2><center> <i>'Every increase in global warming 
matters!!'</i></center></h2>
 <p>In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government 
reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C 
would help us avoid the worst climate impacts 
 and maintain a livable climate. Yet policies currently in place point 
to a 2.8°C temperature rise by the end of the century.
 </p>
 <p>The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the 
world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The 
100 least-emitting countries generate 
 3 per cent of total emissions. The 10 countries with the largest 
emissions contribute 68 per cent. Everyone must take climate action, but people 
and countries creating more of the problem have 
 a greater responsibility to act first.
 </p>

 <br>
 <br>
 <h2> <center><i>'We face a huge challenge but already know many 
solutions!!'</i></center></h2>
 <p>Many climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while 
improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global 
frameworks and agreements to guide progress,
 such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of 
action are: cutting emissions,
 adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.
 </p>
 <p>Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or 
wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to start right 
now. While a growing coalition of countries
 is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, about half of emissions 
cuts must be in place by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C. Fossil fuel production 
must decline by roughly 6 per cent per year
 between 2020 and 2030.
 </p>
 <p>
 Adapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, 
livelihoods, infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and 
those likely in the future. 
 Adaptation will be required everywhere, but must be prioritized now 
for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate 
hazards. The rate of return can be high. 
 Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and 
property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.

 <br>
 <br>
 <h2> <center><i>'We can pay the bill now, or pay dearly in the 
future!!'</i></center></h2>
 <p>Climate action requires significant financial investments by 
governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One 
critical step is for industrialized countries
 to fulfil their commitment to provide $100 billion a year to 
developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.

 <h1><center><i>"Facts and Figures"</i></center></h1>
 <p>We make hundreds of thousands of decisions during our lives.
 The choices we make and the lifestyles we live have a profound 
impact on our planet.
 In fact, our lifestyles are responsible for an estimated two thirds 
of global emissions.
 </p>
 <p>The wealthiest bear the greatest responsibility: the combined 
emissions of the richest 
 one percent of the global population are larger than the combined 
emissions of the poorest 50 percent.
 </p>
 <p>Governments and businesses have an important role to play in 
supporting the necessary lifestyle changes by putting in place the right 
policies,
 infrastructure and incentives. Making it easier for people to use 
cleaner forms of transport or eat more plant-based foods, for instance,
 can help shift consumption patterns, particularly among the world’s 
wealthiest, and could cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 40-70% by 2050.
 </p>
 <p>The Sustainable Development Goals include targets (4.7 and 12.8) to 
ensure that, by 2030, people everywhere have the relevant information, 
 education and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in 
harmony with nature.
 </p>
 <p>Living sustainably also has the potential to improve health and wellbeing for all.</p>
 <h2><i><center>"Current lifestyles are unsustainable"</center></i></h2>
 <p>Demand for natural resources is at an all-time high and continues to 
grow -- for food, clothing, water, housing, infrastructure and other aspects of 
life.
 Resource extraction has more than tripled since 1970, including a 
45% increase in fossil fuel use.
 The extraction and processing of materials, fuels and food contribute 
half of total global greenhouse gas emissions and over 90% of biodiversity loss
 and water stress.
 </p>
 <p>We are using the equivalent of 1.6 Earths to maintain our current way 
of life, and ecosystems cannot keep up with our demands.
 In high-income countries, the material footprint per capita – the 
amount of primary materials needed to meet our needs -- is more than 10 times 
larger
 than in low-income countries. And the Group of 20 major economies 
(G20) accounts for 78% of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
 <h2><i><center>"Here’s where every one of us can make a 
difference"</center></i></h2>
 <h3><b><center>'Home energy'</center></b></h3>
 <p>Electricity drives our lifestyles. Although some 750 million people in 
the world still lack access to electricity, for the rest, everything from a 
computer to a television to a refrigerator needs energy. 
 The energy supply sector (electricity, heat, and other energy) is the 
largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for approx. 
35% of total emissions.
 Globally, residential and commercial buildings, consume over half of 
all electricity.
 Phasing out fossil fuels for home heating is crucial, for instance by 
banning on new gas-fired boilers and introducing electric heat pumps.
 Increasing the thermostat setting from 24°C to 28°C during the 
cooling season can reduce annual cooling energy use by more than a factor of 
three for a typical office building in Zurich, Switzerland.
 Energy demand for cooling is the fastest growing end-use in 
buildings, with ten air conditioners expected to be sold every second over the 
next 30 years.
 Emissions from air conditioning and refrigeration are expected to 
rise 90% from 2017 levels by 2050.
 Being mindful of the living space you need is important, too. In 
developed countries, the average living space per person has dramatically 
increased over the past decades.
 Switching to renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind or 
hydroelectric power, also means less pollution and new and better jobs. 
Currently, around 80% of global energy and 66% of electrical generation are 
supplied from fossil fuels.
 </p>
 <h3><b><center>'Transport'</center></b></h3>
 <p>In most high-income countries, personal transport is the lifestyle 
domain with the largest contribution to the overall lifestyle footprint.
 The world’s roadways are clogged with vehicles, most of them burning 
fossil fuels. Fossil fuels power the ships that carry trade and the airplanes 
that allow us to travel.
 Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector have more than 
doubled since 1970, with around 80% of this increase coming from road vehicles.
 Around 10% of the global population account for 80% of total 
motorized passenger-kilometres, with much of the world’s population hardly 
travelling at all.
 But we do have alternatives to driving that can make a difference. 
Walking, biking, urban public transit and trains help reduce air pollution and 
greenhouse gas emissions.
 Switching to an electric car can help reduce emissions, improve air 
quality and boost green jobs — if the electricity is not powered by fossil fuels. 
By achieving a 60% share of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on the 
road, more than 60 billion tons of CO2 could be saved between now and 2050.
 Domestic and International aviation is responsible for about 10% of 
global emissions in the transport sector, and an estimated 1% of the world 
population is responsible for more than half of these emissions.
 </p>
 <h3><b><center>'Waste'</center></b></h3>
 <p>Every year, an estimated 11.2 billion tonnes of solid waste is 
collected worldwide, and decay of the organic proportion of solid waste is 
contributing about 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
 Where waste cannot be avoided, recycling leads to substantial 
resource savings. For every tonne of paper recycled, 17 trees and 50% of water 
can be saved.
 Recycling also creates jobs: the recycling sector employs 12 million 
people in Brazil, China and United States alone.
 Only 9% of all plastic waste ever produced has been recycled. About 
12% has been incinerated, while the rest — 79% — has accumulated in landfills, 
dumps or the natural environment.
 Using a refillable bottle, bringing your own reusable bag, and asking 
the restaurants you frequent to stop using plastic straws helps reduce plastic 
waste.
 Around the world, one million plastic drinking bottles are purchased 
every minute, while up to 5 trillion single-use plastic bags are used worldwide 
every year. In total, half of all plastic produced is designed to be used only 
once — and then thrown away.
 From 2010 to 2019, e-waste generated globally grew from 5.3 to 7.3 
kilograms per capita annually. Meanwhile, the environmentally sound recycling of 
e-waste increased at a much slower pace – from 0.8 to 1.3 kilograms per capita 
annually.
 </p>
 <h3><b><center>'Fashion'</center></b></h3>
 <p>Being stylish does not mean being wasteful. Buying fewer clothes, 
shopping second-hand, or upcycling, i.e. creating new clothes out of old ones, 
helps save water and reduce waste.
 In the last 15 years, clothing production has doubled while the 
number of times a garment is worn before being discarded has decreased by 36%.
 The fashion industry (clothing and footwear) produces more than 8% of 
the greenhouse gases and 20% of global wastewater annually.
 It takes about 7,500 litres of water to make a single pair of jeans -
- from the production of the cotton to the delivery of the final product to the 
store. 
 85% of textiles end up in landfills or are incinerated although most 
of these materials could be reused. Every second, the equivalent of one garbage 
truck full of textiles is landfilled or burned.
 Some 93 billion cubic meters of water -- enough to meet the 
consumption needs of five million people -- is used by the fashion industry 
annually.

 <center><h1><i>"What are governments doing?"</i></h1></center>
 <p>Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working 
together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to 
keep global warming to 1.5C.
 Egypt is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP27, in 
November, where countries will develop more ambitious plans for cutting emissions 
including reducing fossil fuel use.
 Many countries have pledged to get to "net zero" by 2050. This means 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and balancing out 
remaining emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.
 Experts agree that this is still achievable, but requires 
governments, businesses and individuals to make substantial changes now.

 <h1><center><i>"How will climate change in the future?"</i></center></h1>
 <p>
 Scientists have made major advances in the observations,
 theory, and modelling of Earth’s climate system, and 
 these advances have enabled them to project future climate
 change with increasing confidence. Nevertheless, several 
 major issues make it impossible to give precise estimates 
 of how global or regional temperature trends will evolve
 decade by decade into the future. Firstly, we cannot predict 
 how much CO2 human activities will emit, as this depends on 
 factors such as how the global economy develops and how society’s 
 production and consumption of energy changes in the coming decades.
 Secondly, with current understanding of the complexities of how 
 climate feedbacks operate, there is a range of possible outcomes, 
 even for a particular scenario of CO2 emissions. Finally, over 
 timescales of a decade or so, natural variability can modulate 
 the effects of an underlying trend in temperature. Taken together,
 all model projections indicate that Earth will continue to warm 
 considerably more over the next few decades to centuries. If 
 there were no technological or policy changes to reduce emission
 trends from their current trajectory, then further globally-averaged 
 warming of 2.6 to 4.8 °C (4.7 to 8.6 °F) in addition to that which 
has 
 already occurred would be expected during the 21st century [Figure 
B5].
 Projecting what those ranges will mean for the climate experienced at 
 any particular location is a challenging scientific problem, but 
estimates 
 are continuing to improve as regional and local-scale models advance.
